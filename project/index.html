              <h2>We run Rivers to relax.</h2>
              <p>
                We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for
                relaxing. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar
                philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking
                time to look around and notice the beauty that
                surrounds the rivers we love.

              <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush</h2>
              <p>
                That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things
                after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are
                looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
                appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
