                        We run Rivers to Relax.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for
                        relaxing. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar
                        philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking
                        time to look around and notice the beauty that
                        surrounds the rivers we love.

                    <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush.</h2>
                    <p>
                        That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things
                        after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are
                        looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
                        appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
